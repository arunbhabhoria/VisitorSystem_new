# VisitorSystem_new

I have designed a Visitor System for college/institutions where a visitor pass is generated for visitors coming to college/institution and all record is saved in database. After visitor pass is generated admin can print that pass directly. I have designed this project using PHP.

Features:
- Simple Design
- Easy to use and fast
- Separate login for each gate
- Print generated pass with a single click
- All details saved to database
